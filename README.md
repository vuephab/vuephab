Intuitive Vue frontend to Phabricator utilizing Conduit API

## How is it expected to work?

1. Suppose you have installed Phabricator and it is accessible through base URL <https://phabricator.app>.
2. Vuephab guides user to <https://phabricator.app/conduit/login/> or *Conduit API Tokens* section.
3. Vuephab expects from user to provide it a **Conduit API token** fetched on that page (of course, after successful authentication).
4. User receives cozy gateway in a form of Vuephab interface, so they can enjoy working with Phabricator even more.

## Environment Setup

1. You'll need a stable version of Node.js.

2. Install other dependencies:
   ```bash
   $ npm install
   ```

3. Copy `.env.example` file under name `.env`:
   ```bash
   $ cp .env.example .env
   ```

## Running Vuephab

```bash
# serve with hot reload at BASE_URL
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start
```

## Contibuting

I believe you are familiar that project is still work in progress, so anything concerning the development can be raised and viewed at [GitHub issues](https://github.com/vuephab/vuephab/issues).

Also, thanks for giving star and watching repository! It's some ambitious movement here to engage better project management at no cost.

Basically, if you promote Phabricator in your circles, it's already a good gesture to Vuephab. Important point is that Vuephab is a supplement to Phabricator install and all data is stored in your Phabricator databases as usual.

Vuephab is drastically rewritten stack to meet several user experience considerations that can make project management a joy.
